## Setup

Setup went as expected. Here are some photos from the assembly.

## Questions

1. 

> Distance was calculated using the formula : distance = ( duration * 0.034 ) / 2

> TODO: VAG FILL THIS IN! 



2. A

From our testing, the distances the sensor was able to **reliably** calculate the distance of an object, were:

- Minimum : 2.6 cm 
- Maximum : ~125 cm

For an object distance larger than 125 cm the readings were not reliable. The results were not accurate.



2. B

For objects that are not directly in front of it the sensor tends to either fail to recognise the object  or calculate a distance that is 10-15% greater than that of reference. 



3.

> TODO: VAG CHANGE IT IF IM WRONG



Yes, we can measure pressure from slightly larger areas by placing a "cover" on the sensor and by applying force evenly on that area. We can see someone doing exactly this [on this video](https://youtu.be/SX0636jmktM?t=667). He places the sensor in a 3D printed button that evenly presses down on the force sensor.
