There is hardly any drift in the sensors' readings, especially when the tracked object is in front of the sensor.



2. A

From our testing, the distances the sensor was able to **reliably** calculate the distance of an object, were:

- Minimum : 2.6 cm 
- Maximum : ~105 cm

For an object distance larger than 105 cm the readings were not reliable. The results were not accurate.



2. B

For objects that are not directly in front of it the sensor tends to either fail to recognise the object  or calculate a distance that is 10-15% greater than that of reference.
